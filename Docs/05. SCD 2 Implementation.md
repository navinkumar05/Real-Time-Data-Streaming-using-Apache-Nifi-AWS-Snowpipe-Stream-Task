# 02. SCD 2 Implementation

## pre-requisites:
- stream object working
- windows function
- basic SQL Knowledge
## process flow
1. Create Stream object (`customer_table_changes`)
2. history table (`customer_history`)
3. create view (`v_customer_change_data`)
4. create task (`tsk_scd_hist`)

## code explanation

This code is for managing a customer dimension table using a type 2 slowly changing dimension (SCD2) approach, which tracks historical changes to customer data over time. 

The code first creates or replaces a view called `v_customer_change_data`. This view combines data from the `customer_table_changes` table, which tracks changes to customer data, and the `customer_history` table, which maintains historical records of customer data.

The view selects customer data such as ID, name, email, address, and timestamps of updates. It calculates the start and end timestamps for each change and determines whether the record is current or not. It also adds a column `dml_type` to identify the type of data manipulation language (DML) operation (insert, update, or delete).

After creating the view, the code defines a task called `tsk_scd_hist` to manage the historical records in the `customer_history` table. This task uses a `MERGE` statement to update existing records, insert new records, and mark obsolete records as not current based on the data in the `v_customer_change_data` view. 

Overall, this code automates the process of maintaining historical records of changes to customer data in a data warehouse environment.

### 1. what to do when data is inserted into the customer table
```SQL
-- This subquery figures out what to do when data is inserted into the customer table
-- An insert to the customer table results in an INSERT to the customer_HISTORY table
select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY,
             update_timestamp as start_time,
             lag(update_timestamp) over (partition by customer_id order by update_timestamp desc) as end_time_raw,
             case when end_time_raw is null then '9999-12-31'::timestamp_ntz else end_time_raw end as end_time,
             case when end_time_raw is null then TRUE else FALSE end as is_current
      from (select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY,UPDATE_TIMESTAMP
            from CUSTOMER_DATABASE.SCD2.customer_table_changes
            where metadata$action = 'INSERT'
            and metadata$isupdate = 'FALSE');
```

### 2. what to do when data is updated in the customer table

```SQL
-- This subquery figures out what to do when data is updated in the customer table
-- An update to the customer table results in an update AND an insert to the customer_HISTORY table
-- The subquery below generates two records, each with a different dml_type
select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY, start_time, end_time, is_current, dml_type
from (select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY,
             update_timestamp as start_time,
             lag(update_timestamp) over (partition by customer_id order by update_timestamp desc) as end_time_raw,
             case when end_time_raw is null then '9999-12-31'::timestamp_ntz else end_time_raw end as end_time,
             case when end_time_raw is null then TRUE else FALSE end as is_current, 
             dml_type
      from (-- Identify data to insert into customer_history table
            select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY, update_timestamp, 'I' as dml_type
            from customer_table_changes
            where metadata$action = 'INSERT'
            and metadata$isupdate = 'TRUE'
            union
            -- Identify data in customer_HISTORY table that needs to be updated
            select CUSTOMER_ID, null, null, null, null, null,null,null, start_time, 'U' as dml_type
            from customer_history
            where customer_id in (select distinct customer_id 
                                  from customer_table_changes
                                  where metadata$action = 'DELETE'
                                  and metadata$isupdate = 'TRUE')
     and is_current = TRUE))
```

### 3. what to do when data is deleted from the customer table
```SQL
-- This subquery figures out what to do when data is deleted from the customer table
-- A deletion from the customer table results in an update to the customer_HISTORY table
select ctc.CUSTOMER_ID, null, null, null, null, null,null,null, ch.start_time, current_timestamp()::timestamp_ntz, null, 'D'
from customer_history ch
inner join customer_table_changes ctc
   on ch.customer_id = ctc.customer_id
where ctc.metadata$action = 'DELETE'
and   ctc.metadata$isupdate = 'FALSE'
and   ch.is_current = TRUE;
```

### 4. Create View

union the 3 subqueries.

```SQL
create or replace view v_customer_change_data as
-- This subquery figures out what to do when data is inserted into the customer table
-- An insert to the customer table results in an INSERT to the customer_HISTORY table
select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY,
 start_time, end_time, is_current, 'I' as dml_type
from (
select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY,
             update_timestamp as start_time,
             lag(update_timestamp) over (partition by customer_id order by update_timestamp desc) as end_time_raw,
             case when end_time_raw is null then '9999-12-31'::timestamp_ntz else end_time_raw end as end_time,
             case when end_time_raw is null then TRUE else FALSE end as is_current
      from (select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY,UPDATE_TIMESTAMP
            from CUSTOMER_DATABASE.SCD2.customer_table_changes
            where metadata$action = 'INSERT'
            and metadata$isupdate = 'FALSE')
  )
union

-- This subquery figures out what to do when data is updated in the customer table
-- An update to the customer table results in an update AND an insert to the customer_HISTORY table
-- The subquery below generates two records, each with a different dml_type
select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY, start_time, end_time, is_current, dml_type
from (select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY,
             update_timestamp as start_time,
             lag(update_timestamp) over (partition by customer_id order by update_timestamp desc) as end_time_raw,
             case when end_time_raw is null then '9999-12-31'::timestamp_ntz else end_time_raw end as end_time,
             case when end_time_raw is null then TRUE else FALSE end as is_current, 
             dml_type
      from (-- Identify data to insert into customer_history table
            select CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, STREET, CITY,STATE,COUNTRY, update_timestamp, 'I' as dml_type
            from customer_table_changes
            where metadata$action = 'INSERT'
            and metadata$isupdate = 'TRUE'
            union
            -- Identify data in customer_HISTORY table that needs to be updated
            select CUSTOMER_ID, null, null, null, null, null,null,null, start_time, 'U' as dml_type
            from customer_history
            where customer_id in (select distinct customer_id 
                                  from customer_table_changes
                                  where metadata$action = 'DELETE'
                                  and metadata$isupdate = 'TRUE')
     and is_current = TRUE))
union
-- This subquery figures out what to do when data is deleted from the customer table
-- A deletion from the customer table results in an update to the customer_HISTORY table
select ctc.CUSTOMER_ID, null, null, null, null, null,null,null, ch.start_time, current_timestamp()::timestamp_ntz, null, 'D'
from customer_history ch
inner join customer_table_changes ctc
   on ch.customer_id = ctc.customer_id
where ctc.metadata$action = 'DELETE'
and   ctc.metadata$isupdate = 'FALSE'
and   ch.is_current = TRUE;
```
### 5. Create Task

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE task tsk_scd_hist warehouse= COMPUTE_WH schedule='1 minute' ERROR_ON_NONDETERMINISTIC_MERGE=FALSE AS
MERGE INTO customer_history ch USING v_customer_change_data ccd ON ch.CUSTOMER_ID = ccd.CUSTOMER_ID
AND ch.start_time = ccd.start_time WHEN matched
AND ccd.dml_type = 'U' THEN
UPDATE
SET ch.end_time = ccd.end_time,
    ch.is_current = FALSE WHEN matched
AND ccd.dml_type = 'D' THEN
UPDATE
SET ch.end_time = ccd.end_time,
    ch.is_current = FALSE WHEN NOT matched
AND ccd.dml_type = 'I' THEN
INSERT (CUSTOMER_ID,
        FIRST_NAME,
        LAST_NAME,
        EMAIL,
        STREET,
        CITY,
        STATE,
        COUNTRY,
        start_time,
        end_time,
        is_current)
VALUES (ccd.CUSTOMER_ID, ccd.FIRST_NAME, ccd.LAST_NAME, ccd.EMAIL, ccd.STREET, ccd.CITY,ccd.STATE,ccd.COUNTRY, ccd.start_time, ccd.end_time, ccd.is_current);
```

### 6. Alter the task
```sql
show tasks;
alter task tsk_scd_hist suspend;--resume --suspend
```
